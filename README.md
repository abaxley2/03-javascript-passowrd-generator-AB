# 03-javascript-passowrd-generator-AB

## Description
The assignment was to create a functional password generator that prompts the user for input criteria and 
displays a randomized password. I first created functions that generate random characters. I then created window promps, alerts, 
and confirms to gather user date. I then assigned each of these to an array and created a for loop to generate a password.
